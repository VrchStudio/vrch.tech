VRCH LIMITED is a tech start-up specified in designing and developing mixed-reality experience. We utilize networked mixed-reality technologies to accelerate the digital revolution of architecture industry. The company was founded by architectural designer and XR innovator Mingxuan Xie in London, along with other programmers, architects, artists and game developers from UK, Canada and China. The company fully embraced “digital nomads” methodology to achieve worldwide interdisciplinary collaborations. We have successfully developed professional AR and VR applications for architectural firms around the world.

To explore new boundaries beyond industrial applications, VRCH is actively participating in experimental art projects and game development. Our team members have worked for mixed-reality projects exhibited in the London Architectural Festival, Ginza Sony Park, Jerusalem Design Week and China Academy of Art.
